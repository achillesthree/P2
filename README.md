I was to create web application from scratch. A portfolio page, which I can add to as the course progresses.

This will showcase my skills and talents to employers looking to fill a part-time or full-time position.

##Features
This this site is the beginning of showcasing my work. Features on this site include my name, photo, links to sections about me, my work and how to contact me. Links scroll to corresponding sections, as well as to outside external spots where my work is located. The first application is bigger to highlight my "best" work. When the app is deployed on various screens the layout is repsonsive and adjusts to the viewpoint of the reader/user.
